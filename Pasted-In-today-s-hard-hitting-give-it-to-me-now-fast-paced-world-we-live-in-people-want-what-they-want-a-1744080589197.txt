In today's hard hitting, give it to me now, fast-paced world we live in people want what they want and they want it now and not later and they want it how they want it no bull shit no extra no less mistakes are accounted for but time is valuable. Who has time to get online let alone go to multiple different places/websites/apps/stores/platforms to get the final product they are looking for? Not one person! People are into convenience because time is a very valuable thing. We will be the supply for any and all cannabis demands.

Any 18 year old or older worldwide User is at home/in car/in bathroom/on a mountain top/middle of the ocean/middle of nowhere/anywhere/grandmothers house/riding around/running from something/late for something/waiting for something/and wants or thinks about anything to do with anything about anything cannabis/marijuana and get online and type in what they want and......  BOOM up pops The HempPimp, user clicks on our link, user goes to our site and when the screen loads they see a hyper-realistic Groot inspired but female cannabis figure that is made to resemble groot but instead of weed she is made out of a Cannabis bud. She is sitting there smoking a blunt and each puff of smoke is website information(details, mission, menu, services, facts, tips, gamification chances, etc) the puffs of smoke turn into an interactive menu and there is a search bar and a place to insert text/ideas that when u hit enter it sends the text it also has a send button that will send the text or send the uploaded file for analysis with a voice search button that you can tell it what you want and it goes from there, it will respond accordingly it has fie access and analyze (txt, md, csv, pdf, zip) and uses it accordingly so no matter if they want to make something that's not already there like a custom bong they don't have or that they want or just a pipe they don't have or they want or custom rolling papers or stickers or decals or toys or shelves or your grow room needs a shelve or a bracket or u need a grow room of any specifications. You can immersively interact with what u r making, you can virtually try it on different things to see how it looks, interact and make changes, needed products for it

Take and mix Willie Nelson, Snoop Dog, Tu Pac, Bruce Lee, and Jon Lennon and you roll them all up into one big super fat blunt and you roll them up using an Ai(Artificial Intelligence) flavored blunt wrap and a swagger filled college kid smokes it all at once by himself use that outcome ( a super-stoned, hard-hustlin', tech-savvy, peace lovin' hippie gangster), and the colors of marijuana/cannabis(greens, greys, reds, oranges, browns, purples), some black, some silver, some gold and some yellows and some shading and some shadowing and some padding. Use some neo-brutalism, sum glass-morphism, some, some Skeuomorphism, some Minimalism, some Neumorphism, some Claymorphism, some Retro-Futurism, some funky twists, some high powered aesthetics and give it a nostalgically, retro but fun and professional futuristic look that jumps out and says hey look at me. Each section/page/screen of the website/app is uniquely defined in its own prominent and unique non-standard border and aesthetically flowing attention grabbing masterpiece 

No inventory on anything because we can source and procure everything(wood to workers, screw to vent, seed to flame, nails to wiring, cameras to touch screens, sensors to ventalation, chemicals to soil, cannabis dream to reality) in eco-friendly, sustainable and biodegradable products thru automatic drop shipping. 

No Home base so we can grow as we grow

We do not have to worry about legal aspect but once for our stuff because the user is the buyer we just are connecting them so they have to make sure they are legal

To prevent the team (wife and I) from building everything, since our $0 budget, our pinch our poke, our kick our punch, our little bit of weed to smoke, our whole hell of alotta hope, and our readiness, willingness and ability to get out there and kiss some hands and shake some babies only gets so far and being as everything we are going to do already exists seperately by others.......... Look at it like this from the street prospective " the dealer goes to his "plug" and the "plug" goes to his "plug" and that "plug" goes to his "plug" and so on, We will be the "Socket" they all plug into..
